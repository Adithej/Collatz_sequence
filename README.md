The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
starts with any positive integer `n` .Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
If the previous term is even, the next term will be half of the previous term.
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
The conjecture is that no matter what value of `n` the sequence will always reach 1.
